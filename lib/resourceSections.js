          'The biggest mistake many job seekers make is applying to hundreds of positions and hoping something sticks. Today’s market does not reward volume. It rewards precision and relationships.',
          'One of the most effective strategies is the 80/20 method: spend roughly 80% of your time on networking, outreach, conversations, and follow-ups, and 20% of your time on applications. This feels backwards at first, but more than half of real opportunities come from people, not job boards.',
          'A simple weekly structure might look like this: on Monday, identify target roles and companies and send a few outreach messages. On Tuesday and Wednesday, tailor and submit a small number of high-quality applications. On Thursday and Friday, follow up, reconnect with people, and review what is working.',
          'This approach does three important things. First, it keeps you from burning out by chasing every listing. Second, it makes your applications much stronger because they are targeted. Third, it turns your job search into a system with rhythm, rather than a random burst of activity whenever you see a posting.',
          'When you follow the 80/20 method, your job search stops feeling like shouting into the void and starts feeling like a series of intentional moves toward the roles you actually want.',
