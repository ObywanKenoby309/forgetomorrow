Founder Story

ForgeTomorrow didn’t begin with a pitch deck or a roadmap.

It began with a post that froze me in place:
“…we lost another one to the job search.”

Another person overwhelmed by a system that treats humans like noise — filtered out by automated gatekeepers, buried under black-hole applications, pushed past the edge of hope.

That word — “another” — stayed with me.
It still does.

At the time, I was fighting my own battle in the job market.
Every day, I watched good people break under a process I’d spent years helping companies maintain.
And that night something in me shifted.

If no one else was going to fix this, I would.
Even if I had to build it from nothing.

No investors.
No team.
No roadmap.
Just a laptop, a belief that people deserved better, and one AI partner — Sora — who helped me build it brick by brick, line by line.

ForgeTomorrow became a place where candidates aren’t filtered out — they’re understood.
Where coaches have a home in the process.
Where recruiters get transparent, human-first tools instead of black boxes.

We’re still small.
Still independent.
Still forging it one line at a time.

But every feature, every decision, every late night goes back to this truth:

No one should ever feel like “another.”

Their forge awaits.
